Our web app will provide users with all the information they need to know everything about their desired artists. This web applictaion will also help introduce users to local artists, which enables them to have the incomparable experience of seeing these artists live. This product also helps promote local artists who intend to rise up their popularity and make an impact on the music industry.
Other information users can view will include: Artist History, Images, Videos, TShirts, Spotify, YouTube, Twitter, song Lyrics with translation along with the ability to purchase tickets to their events.
All this and more is possible with Bandroid.

In this first iteration of the application the user will be able to get on the site and the app will automatically retreive the location of the user ( if allowed ), or the user could enter the location themselves. The app will then display concerts and shows near the user in a list. When the user clicks on items in the list the app will display information about the event, the artist along with a link to purchase tickets. The search bar could also be used to get information on other artists however at this point it will give information on anything and it depends on the search term having an unambiguous wikipedia page. 
Other small features will be added in later iterations.
